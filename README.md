Garment Worker Productivity â€“ Regression Project
Project Overview :

The Garment Worker Productivity Dataset captures key attributes from the garment manufacturing industry in 2015. The dataset highlights various factors influencing worker productivity. This project applies machine learning regression techniques to predict worker productivity and identify the most significant features that affect output.

Objective :

To predict the productivity of garment workers and analyze the features that contribute most to their performance.

Technical Approach :

Performed data quality checks (handling missing values, outliers, and feature encoding).

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations such as pair plots and heatmaps.


Key Findings :

Incentives had the strongest influence on productivity.

The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model achieved the best performance with an MAE of 0.0626
